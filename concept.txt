Programming - programming language --> computer programming language
computer Hardware (cpu, input/output, memory)
Programming to make/develop program
program to make things easy

Language we chose: Python
0.) Setup
(compiler/interpreter - executes the code I wrote --> We need python)
(Github desktop - Upload and download code and files from web)
(Code Editor - helps you write/edit code {atom})

test --> print code (print ("") )

1.) Data and Operation
  - number
  - Boolean (true/false : 0, "", false, [], {} )
  - String ("")

Operation
- Arithmetic --> add(+) sub(-) div(/) multi(*) exponential (**) modulus(%)
- Logical --> and, not, or
- compare --> == != > < >= <=

2.) Variable
Use as a container of data
Name = Data (= is assign)
reassign can be used below the first assignment

collection (to group data)
Dictionary & List

exlist = ["---", "---"]
2 elements, index0, index 1
number index

Dictionary
exdict = {
  "keyA" : "valueA",
  "keyB" : "valueB"
}
2 Elements (key-value pair)
index(keyA) index(keyB)
name index

3.) control
- Branch (if/elif/else, (switch) )
- Loop (for loop, while loop)
- Exception (try, catch, finally) : increase performance, advanced technique (maybe not on this class)

Statement: does not contain a value (a = 3, print(a))
Expression: contains a value (a, a + 3)

scope : code block to be executed when condition(expr for the control code) is true.
