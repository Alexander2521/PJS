Programming - programming language --> computer programming language
computer Hardware (cpu, input/output, memory)
Programming to make/develop program
program to make things easy

Language we chose: Python
0.) Setup
(compiler/interpreter - executes the code I wrote --> We need python)
(Github desktop - Upload and download code and files from web)
(Code Editor - helps you write/edit code {atom})

test --> print code (print ("") )

Terminal
* cd FOLDERNAME : change directory, goes to FOLDERNAME folder which is inside current folder
  * FOLDERNAME can be a PATH : E.G. Desktop/PJS/HW
  * When you want to go go the parent folder, put ".." instead of FOLDERNAME
* ls : shows all files and folders inside current folder


1.) Data and Operation
  - number
  - Boolean (true/false : 0, "", false, [], {} )
  - String ("")

Operation
- Arithmetic --> add(+) sub(-) div(/) multi(*) exponential (**) modulus(%)
- Logical --> and, not, or
- compare --> == != > < >= <=

2.) Variable
Use as a container of data
Name = Data (= is assign)
reassign can be used below the first assignment

collection (to group data)
Dictionary & List

exlist = ["---", "---"]
2 elements, index0, index 1
number index

Dictionary
exdict = {
  "keyA" : "valueA",
  "keyB" : "valueB"
}
2 Elements (key-value pair)
index(keyA) index(keyB)
name index

3.) control
- Branch (if/elif/else, (switch) )
- Loop (for loop, while loop)
- Exception (try, catch, finally) : increase performance, advanced technique (maybe not on this class)

Statement: does not contain a value (a = 3, print(a))
Expression: contains a value (a, a + 3)

scope : code block to be executed when condition(expr for the control code) is true.


4.) function
- similar to a program
input --> work --> output
input is known as a parameter (can be more than 1)
output is known as the return value

How to MAKE a function (Python)
def functName (parameter1, parameter2, ...):
-->                                                                |(scope)
-->                                                                |(scope)
-->  return(output) Expression                                     |(scope)

How to USE a function
functName ( expression1, expression2, ... {inserted} ) => expression (return value)

5.) Class & Objects
Class : "blueprint" for creating Objects
Objects(= instance) : "examples/samples/products" created by Class sharing methods & properties.
Method : function in object/ Class
Property : special values that are included within a class/object
Inheritance : when the parent class and child class is created, the child class inherits all of the parent classes' property and methods.
__init__ method: assign values when the object is being created
Self Parameter (in first Parameter of method) : reference to current object --> used to access variables which belong to the class

6.) Modules
Modules are like code library --> used to import codes
library: other people's code -> collection of functions and methods that allows you to perform many actions without writing your code.
code splitting: When your code in single file is too long, split them into multiple files.
                Take a function or code from another file by importing it when you need one.
import : When you take a code fragment(fucntion, variable, class) from another file and try to use it --> you need to import the file name
from : When you import, the idea of from allows you to write the file name you need to use/import.

7.) Advanced
saved for later.
